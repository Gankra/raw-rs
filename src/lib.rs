#![feature(slicing_syntax)]

//! Utilities for working with the raw representations of core Rust data types.
//!
//! This library provides convenience methods and types for doing `unsafe` work in a more
//! ergonomic way. It provides extension traits for the raw pointer types `*const T` and `*mut T`,
//! as well as the raw slice types `*const [T]` and `*mut [T]`. It also provides a wrapper for
//! slices that has all of its operations unchecked. Functionality is separated into modules so
//! that they can opted into individually using a glob import.
//!
//! For the most part, the methods provided are conveniences for those found in the `std::ptr` API,
//! which can be a bit awkward. Method names reflect a proposed set of names for `std::ptr`
//! stabilization, and not the actual names. Should `std::ptr` be stabilized, these may be renamed.
//!
//! Note also that an *ideal* implementation of this library provides many of the offered methods
//! as unsafe *operators*. Unfortunately, this is not currently possible in Rust as of this
//! writing. We instead settle for named methods that mirror these operators.
